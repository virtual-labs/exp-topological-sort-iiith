### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, we will be able to do the following:

   - Given a directed acyclic graph of numbers, generate a topological ordering of numbers by applying the algorithms.
   - Demonstrate knowledge of time complexity of both algorithms by counting the number of operations involved in each iteration.
