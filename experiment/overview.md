### Prerequisites of the Experiment

This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about:

   - [The Notion of Directed Acyclic Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)
   - [Notion of Time and Space Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)
   - [Graphs (Directed and Undirected) and Trees](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/)
   - [Notion of Time and Space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)
   - [Notion of Trees and types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))
   - [Notion of DFS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/)

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore!

###Overview of the Experiment

   - The aim of this experiment is to understand the Topological Sort algorithms - Depth First Search and Kahn's algorithm along with their time and space complexity.
   - The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
